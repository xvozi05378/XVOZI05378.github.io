    <h1>You walk into the mist.</h1>
    <p>The fog is so thick, you can't see anything. But soon, you bump into something.</p>
    <p>Feeling around, you discover a lock. Excitedly, you blindly pick the lock. The chest opens, revealing a puzzle.</p>
    <p>You can slide one tile. If you get it correct, you win. Otherwise... Game Over.</p>
    <p>To win, you must deal 5 damage to the top side. This may be a good time to explain the rules.</p>

    <p>The bottom side represents your cards. They will attack the opponent directly if the opposing space is empty, but will instead the opposing card if there is one. For example, the stoat will attack the coyote, while the bullfrog will attack directly. You need not heed any of the symbols on the cards for the time being. The unopposed opposing creatures will attack you as well, lowering the number.</p>
