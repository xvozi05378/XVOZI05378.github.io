    <h1>You continued through the misty path with the body of the coyote behind you..</h1>
    <p>The fog cleared.</p>
    <p>You walked into a clearing. It seemed empty, except for an altar in the middle. You can't find a use for it.</p>
    <p>You decide to move forward when you hear leaves rustling behind you.</p>
